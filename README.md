# Friend Finder
### A compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application

Friend Finder is a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" site that takes in results from users' surveys, compares their answers with those of other users, and then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Motivation
Friend Finder is a full-stack app, which complies with the guidelines of:
* Utilizing npm packages to access and format data.
* Establishing a package.json for npm package version info and install requirements.
* Using Express for server functionality.
* Deploying to GitHub.
* Deploying to Heroku.

## Project Usefulness
This web app is useful as a tool for working with Express server data data through interaction and form input from a user.  It provides an example of how npm packages can be utilized to assist in connecting to a server, parsing JSON data, and utilizing GET and POST routes.

## APIs / Libraries / Technology used
In order to provide the user with this information, the following are used:

* npm - body-parser
* npm - express
* npm - path
